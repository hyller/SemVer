## Context
These steps would be done to release a software normally  
1) Increase version number manually, for example, increase 0.1.0 to 0.2.0.  
2) Rebuild your software and get the target file manually, for example target.hex.  
3) Append the version number to the target file manually, for example target_0.2.0.hex.  

**SemVer** aims to do the step 1 and step 3.


## What can SemVer Do

**SemVer** creates version head file, increases version and appends the version to a file name.  
The version format defined in [semver.org](http://semver.org).  

## Build from code

There are prebuild binaries in folder bin. You can try to use them directly. .exe is for windows and .out is for linux.

If you want to build it from code. GCC is required to be installed. Mingw, Cygwin or native Linux is workable.

Run 'make' to build the executable binary. Run 'make check' to run the test.

## Usage

Usage: semver [option] [file]  
  
Options:  
-x,  Increase major version number.  
-y,  Increase minor version number.  
-z,  Increase patch version number.  
-v,  Print program version.  
-h,  Print this help screen.  
-s,  Process simple version string.  
-a,  Append version string to a file name.  
-i,  Initialize version.  
-n,  Specify version definition name.   
-d,  Include modify date in version header file.   

## Example

Create a head file version.h with initial version value 0.1.0  
	semver -i0.1.0 version.h

Increase the version value to 0.1.1  
	semver -z version.h

Increase the version value to 0.2.0  
	semver -y version.h

Increase the version value to 1.0.0  
	semver -x version.h

Append version to file target.hex to target_1.0.0.hex  
	semver -atarget.hex version.h
